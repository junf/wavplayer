Simple Player of 'wav' file on Windows

On Windows, starting with Vista, player of 'wav' files that can be used on the command line does not come.
Therefore, I created this. This is a very simple player.

When you run to give one argument (path of a wav file), then play it.

[Usage]
wavplayer path_of_wav_file
